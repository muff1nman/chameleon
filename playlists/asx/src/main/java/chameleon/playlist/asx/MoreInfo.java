 * Specifies an URL for a Web site, e-mail address, or script command associated with a show, clip, or banner.
 * The user can access the target of the URL by clicking on the graphic or text associated with the MOREINFO element.
 * The details depend on the parent element of the MOREINFO element:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the HREF parameter specifies a URL to a Web site, the browser opens and navigates to the URL.</li>
 * <li>If the HREF attribute specifies an e-mail address, the user's e-mail application starts.</li>
 * <li>If the HREF attribute specifies a script command, the script command executes in the browser.</li>
 * </ul>
 * If the MOREINFO element appears within an ASX or ENTRY element, when the mouse cursor is held over the title of the show (for an ASX element)
 * or clip (for an ENTRY element), the URL defined in the HREF attribute can be selected and accessed by Windows Media Player.

     * Returns a value defining the frame or window in which the browser will open the page defined by the HREF attribute.
     * The values for this attribute follow standard HTML syntax and definitions.
     * In the case of a control embedded in a Web page, if no TARGET attribute is defined,
     * the URL loads the current browser window and replaces the existing page, which means the content stops playing.
     * Therefore, it is recommended that you always specify a TARGET attribute when embedding the Windows Media Player control in a Web page.

     * If the metafile is opened in the stand-alone Windows Media Player, the TARGET attribute is ignored, and the URL loads in an existing browser window.
     * If there is no browser window currently open, the URL loads in a new browser window.
     * <br>

     * <dl>
     * <dt>_blank</dt><dd>The document loads in a new browser window.</dd>
     * <dt>_self</dt><dd>The document loads in the same frame as the current document containing the Windows Media Player control.</dd>
     * <dt>_parent</dt><dd>The document loads in the immediate parent frame of the current frame, or the current frame if there is no parent frame.</dd>
     * <dt>_top</dt><dd>The document loads in the full browser window, replacing all other frames or documents.</dd>
