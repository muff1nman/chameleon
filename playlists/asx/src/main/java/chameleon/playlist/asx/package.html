The Advanced Stream Redirector (ASX) format is a type of XML metafile designed to store a list of Windows Media files to play during a multimedia presentation.
It is used frequently on streaming video servers where multiple ASF files are to be played in succession.
Both RTSP and MMS streaming protocols are supported, as well as HTTP.

"Advanced Stream Redirector (ASX) files are based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML) syntax,
and are made up of various elements with their associated tags and attributes.
Each element in an ASX file defines a particular setting or action to the Microsoft&reg; Windows Media&reg; Player control.
Some elements must be located in a specific position in the file relative to other elements.
Some elements have required tags and attributes that must be defined in the ASX file.
Element names and attributes are not case-sensitive.
<br>
The most important part of successfully using ASX files is the correct syntax of the ASX elements.
Syntax errors in an ASX file can cause anything from a single attribute being overlooked,
to the ASX file not being recognized as valid and failing to work at all.
Almost as important is the order in which the elements appear in the ASX file.
The attributes of some elements temporarily override the attributes of similar elements in different sections of the ASX file.
<br>
<b>Important</b>
<ul>
    <li>ASX element and attribute tags are not case sensitive.
    The text used in the ASX file to define an element can be either upper or lower case, or a mix of both.
    The opening and closing tags used in an element also can be different case.</li>
    <li>If an element tag does not have any child elements (those that modify or are contained within another element),
    a single slash character ("/") can be used at the end of the opening tag in place of a closing tag.
    If the child elements do not appear between the opening and closing tag for an element,
    they are not child elements for that element and will be ignored or cause an error in the syntax of the ASX file.</li>
