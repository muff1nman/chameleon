/**
 * Specifies the length of time a clip is played in preview mode.
 * <br>
 * If this element appears within an ENTRY element or a REF element, it applies to the clip defined by that element.
 * If it appears within the scope of an ASX element, it applies to every clip in the metafile.
 * A PREVIEWDURATION element in a REF element takes precedence over one in an ENTRY element,
 * and either takes precedence over a PREVIEWDURATION element in an ASX element.
 * If no PREVIEWDURATION element is defined for a clip, the default preview time is 10 seconds.
 * <br>
 * If there is a STARTTIME or STARTMARKER element for the clip, Windows Media Player renders the clip starting at the point defined by one of these elements;
 * otherwise it renders from the beginning of the clip.
 * The clip stops normally if it is shorter than the time defined by the PREVIEWDURATION element.
 * <br>
 * The DURATION element overrides a PREVIEWDURATION element.
 * <br>
 * Windows Media Player version 7.0 or later.
 * Not supported on Windows CE.
