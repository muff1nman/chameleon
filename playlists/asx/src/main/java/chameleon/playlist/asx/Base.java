/**
 * Defines an URL string appended to the front of URLs sent to the Windows Media Player control.
 * This element defines a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) string appended to the front of URL-flip URLs sent to the WMP control.
 * URL-flipping is a scripting mechanism that causes the WMP control to open a new URL in a browser or browser frame when it receives a script command.
 * <br>
 * The BASE element is similar to a home directory for relative links.
 * It only affects URLs sent using script commands as part of the content stream that is playing in the WMP control.
 * <br>
 * A BASE element defined as the child of an ASX element becomes the default for the entire Advanced Stream Redirector (ASX) file.
 * A BASE element defined in an ENTRY element overrides any BASE element in the parent ASX element (for that ENTRY element only).
 * <br>
 * <b>Note</b>: if the HREF parameter does not end with a '/' character, the WMP control appends one to the end of the string.
