package chameleon.playlist.asx;

/**
 * Specifies an URL for a piece of digital media content.
 * The URL can point to any media type supported, using any protocol supported by the WMP control.
 * <br>
 * The media types supported include still images such as .gif and .jpg images and Flash files with an .swf file name extension.
 * These media types are useful for including advertising content within a playlist.
 * With image files and Flash files that play in a loop,
 * you must also specify the amount of time to display the media item by including a DURATION element within the REF element.
 * If you want an image to continue displaying while the next entry in the playlist is buffered, include a PARAM element within the ENTRY element,
 * set its name attribute to ShowWhileBuffering, and set its value attribute to true.
 * <br>
 * To reference content on a CD or a DVD that allows it, the wmpcd and wmpdvd protocols are provided.
 * For example, setting the HREF attribute to "wmpdvd://f/5/3" will play chapter 3 of title 5 on a DVD, but only if the DVD has been authored to allow it.
 * <br>
 * Applications that open digital media from behind a firewall will have better performance when opening the media items
 * if the address is specified using the domain name server (DNS) name instead of the IP address.
 * <br>
 * The most common use of this element is for URL rollover.
 * If the WMP control is unable to open a piece of media defined in a REF element, it tries the URL in the next REF element.
 * Once the WMP control opens media content from a URL defined within the scope of one ENTRY element,
 * it ignores subsequent REF tags within that ENTRY element.
 * After the piece of content is done playing, the WMP control moves on to the next ENTRY element, if any.
 * <br>
 * <b>Important</b>: once the WMP control establishes a connection to a referenced piece of content, it ignores all other REF elements in that ENTRY,
 * whether the connection terminates normally or abnormally.
 * <br>
 * If the media item referenced is an image file, the DURATION element must be used to specify the display time for the image.
 * <br>
 * Note: attempting to play Flash media that includes sound with the first frame may yield unexpected results.
 * You should author Flash content to play sound starting no earlier than the second frame.
 * <br>
 * Windows Media Player version 7.0 or later.
