/**
 * Defines a behavior or action taken by Windows Media Player when it receives a script command labeled as an event.
 * An event is a particular type of script command embedded in a stream sent to the WMP control that consists of a double string.
 * The first string is the word "event", and the second string is the event name.
 * The event name in the second string must match the event name defined in the ASX file (the match is not case-sensitive).
 * Events can be sent to a WMP control receiving a real-time stream,
 * or can be saved in an .asf, .wma, or .wmv file that gets delivered as an on-demand unicast stream.
 * When the WMP control receives the script command, it processes the event as defined by the EVENT element.
 * <br>
 * This element defines a scope of ENTRY or ENTRYREF elements that are processed whenever the WMP control receives the script command with the named event.
 * The ENTRYREF can be a URL that points to an ASP page.
 * With this element, you can specify a behavior for stream switching in near real-time,
 * as opposed to pre-authored stream changes using references to other pieces of content or ASX files.
 * <br>
 * When you use ASP pages to generate playlists, you must specify a value for the Response.ContentType property and the Response.expires property
 * in the ASP page because of latency issues with Windows Media Player.
 * The Response.ContentType must be a valid file name extension for Windows Media metafiles.
 * Valid types include .asf, .asx, .wma, .wax, .wmv, and .wvx.
 * <br>
 * See the Platform SDK for details about using the Response object in ASP.
 * <br>
 * This element can appear anywhere within the ASX element.
 * If multiple EVENT elements within an ASX element have identical values for their NAME attributes,
 * the WMP control uses the first occurrence within the ASX element, and ignores all others.
 * When EVENT elements have distinct NAME attributes, their order within the ASX element does not matter.
 * <br>
 * The WMP control discards events it receives while processing another event.
 * Nesting of events is not supported.
 * When Windows Media Player is in preview mode, event content is not constrained by the PREVIEWDURATION element;
 * the full length of event content can play even if the preview duration for the active ENTRY element expires prior to the end of the event.
