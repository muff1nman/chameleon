/**
 * Links to the ENTRY elements in an external Windows Media metafile that has an .asx, .wax, .wvx, or .wmx extension.
 * This element points the contents of an external ASX file.
 * The WMP control processes the ENTRY elements of the referenced ASX file as if they were included in the primary ASX file at the position of the ENTRYREF element.
 * However, it skips any ENTRY elements in the referenced ASX file that have the SKIPIFREF attribute set to YES.
 <br>
 * Windows Media Player 7.0, 7.1, and Windows Media Player for Windows XP ignore any ENTRYREF elements in the referenced ASX file.
 * Thus, ASX files can only be nested one level deep when using these versions of the Player.
 * The WMP control also ignores the ASX element in the referenced file along with its attributes.
 * Windows Media Player 9 Series or later supports nesting metafiles up to five levels deep.
 * <br>
 * The URL specified in the HREF attribute becomes the base URL for any relative URLs in the external metafile.
 * This URL is used when an entry from the external metafile is playing and the user adds it to the library.
