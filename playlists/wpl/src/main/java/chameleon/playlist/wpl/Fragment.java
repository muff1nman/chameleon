/**
 * Specifies one condition of the query that selects items from the library.
 * Conditions are specified by condition strings.
 * A condition string typically has a name portion, a condition portion, and a value portion.
 * <br>
 * Certain condition strings have a metadata attribute portion, a condition portion, and a value portion.
 * For example, in the condition string "Album Artist Is Joe", the metadata attribute portion is "Album Artist",
 * the condition portion is "Is", and the value portion is "Joe".
 * <br>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;fragment name = "Album Artist"&gt;
 *  &lt;argument name = "condition"&gt;Is&lt;/argument&gt;
 *  &lt;argument name = "value"&gt;Joe&lt;/argument&gt;
 * &lt;/fragment&gt;
 * </pre>
 * For condition strings of this type, the following table shows the possible metadata attributes, possible conditions and possible values:
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Metadata attribute</th>
 * <th>Possible conditions</th>
 * <th>Possible values</th>
 * <tr>

 * <td>Contains, Does Not Contain</td>
 * <td>Any string</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * Certain condition strings have a limiter portion, a number portion and a format portion.
 * For example in the condition string "Limit Total Size To 3 Megabytes", the limiter portion is "Limit Total Size To",
 * the number portion is "3" and the format portion is "Megabytes".
 * <br>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;fragment name = "Limit Total Size To"&gt;
 *  &lt;argument name = "number"&gt;3&lt;/argument&gt;
 *  &lt;argument name = "format"&gt;Megabytes&lt;/argument&gt;
 * &lt;/fragment&gt;
 * </pre>
 * For condition strings of this type the following table shows the possible limiters and formats:
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Limiter</th>
 * <th>Possible numbers</th>
 * <th>Possible formats</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Limit Total Size To</td>
 * <td>Any number</td>
 * <td>Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Limit Total Duration To</td>
 * <td>Any number</td>
 * <td>Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * Certain condition strings have a limiter portion and a number portion.
 * For example in the condition string "Limit Number of Items to 25", the limiter portion is "Limit Number of Items" and the number portion is "25".
 * <br>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;fragment name = "Limit Number of Items"&gt;
 *  &lt;argument name = "number"&gt;25&lt;/argument&gt;
 * &lt;/fragment&gt;
 * </pre>
 * For condition strings of this type the following table shows the only possible limiter:
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Limiter</th>
 * <th>Possible numbers</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Limit Number Of Items</td>
 * <td>Any number</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * Certain condition strings have a protection portion and a condition portion.
 * For example in the condition string "Protection Is present", the protection portion is "Protection" and the condition portion is "Is".
 * <br>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;fragment name = "Protection"&gt;
 *  &lt;argument name = "condition"&gt;Is&lt;/argument&gt;
 * &lt;/fragment&gt;
 * </pre>
 * For condition strings of this type the following table shows the possible conditions:
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Protection portion</th>
 * <th>Possible conditions</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Protection</td>
 * <td>Is, Is Not</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * There is one type of fragment element that does not contain a condition string.
 * If the name attribute of a fragment element is "Randomize Playback Order" the fragment element contains no argument elements.
 * This fragment element instructs the player to play the list in random order.
 * <br>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;fragment name = "Randomize Playback Order"&gt;
 * &lt;/fragment&gt;
 * </pre>
 * Certain condition strings have a sort portion, a value portion and a condition portion.
 * For example, in the condition string "Sort By Title Ascending order", the sort portion is "Sort By", the value portion is "Title",
 * and the condition portion is "Ascending".
 * Note that in this case the value portion is a metadata attribute.
 * <br>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;fragment name = "Sort By"&gt;
 *  &lt;argument name = "value"&gt;Title&lt;/argument&gt;
 *  &lt;argument name = "condition"&gt;Ascending&lt;/argument&gt;
 * &lt;/fragment&gt;
 * </pre>
 * For condition strings of this type the following table shows the possible values and conditions:
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Sort portion</th>
 * <th>Possible values</th>
 * <th>Possible conditions</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Sort By</td>
 * <td>Genre, Title, Date Added, Auto Rating, My Rating, Play Count : Total Overall, Play Count : Morning Totals, Play Count : Afternoon Totals, Play Count : Evening Totals, Play Count : Night Totals, Play Count : Total Weekday, Play Count : Total Weekend, Actor, Subtitle, Station name, Channel, Broadcast time, Director, Release Year, Writer, Producer, Date Recorded, Date Encoded, Bit Rate, Protection</td>
 * <td>Ascending, Descending, Random</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * When you use a fragment element to sort a playlist, you must sort on a metadata attribute that applies to the type of media items you are sorting.
 * For example, if you are sorting music items you can not sort on Actor.
 * The following table shows which metadata attributes you can use to sort which media types:
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Media type</th>
 * <th>Possible metadata attributes</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Music</td>
 * <td>Genre, Title, Date Added, Auto Rating, My Rating, Play Count : Total Overall, Play Count : Morning Totals, Play Count :Afternoon Totals, Play Count :Evening Totals, Play Count :Night Totals, Play Count :Total Weekday, Play Count : Total Weekend</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Video or TV</td>
 * <td>Genre, Actor, Subtitle, Title, Date Added, Auto Rating, Station name, Channel, Broadcast time, Director, Release Year, Writer, Producer, Date Recorded, Date Encoded, Bit Rate, My Rating, Protection, Play Count : Total Overall, Play Count : Morning Totals, Play Count : Afternoon Totals, Play Count : Evening Totals, Play Count : Night Totals, Play Count : Total Weekday, Play Count : Total Weekend</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Radio</td>
 * <td>Title, Date Added, Bit Rate</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Photo</td>
 * <td>Title</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Other</td>
 * <td>Genre, Title, Date Added, Auto Rating, My Rating, Bit Rate, Play Count : Total Overall, Play Count : Morning Totals, Play Count : Afternoon Totals, Play Count : Evening Totals, Play Count : Night Totals, Play Count : Total Weekday, Play Count : Total Weekend</td>
